   - Check macOS Version for Compatibility >=10.15
   - RAM Size > 4 GB
   - VirtualBox <= 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop
   - Download Docker Desktop Binary based on Chipset Type and install in headless mode 
    - If Chipset type is Apple Silicon, install Rosetta 2
    - Check buildkit is set to false for Apple Chip in ~/.docker/daemon.json
1. Test Docker Setup 
    - Run speed test `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1  docker run --rm rajasoun/speedtest:0.1.0 "/go/bin/speedtest-go"`
1. Mac [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
1. Package Manager -[brew](https://brew.sh/)
   - [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/)
   - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
   - Code Editor (IDE) - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
